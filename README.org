#+TITLE: qrxfil

Exfiltrate files via QR codes.

Splits files across many QR codes for "sending" across air-gapped
computer systems. Generates numbered PNG files to scan.

The codes contain metadata about chunk number (e.g. "07 of 78") to
enable out-of-order scanning.

* Dependencies

=qrxfil= is built in Rust, relying on:
- [[https://crates.io/crates/base64][base64]], to encode binary in ASCII characters
- [[https://crates.io/crates/qrcode][qrcode]], to generate the codes themselves

* Status

This is a toy project meant to learn Rust, for which a Bash proof of
concept was built as reference.

None of the features announced are currently implemented

* Development

Using =cargo=, build the binary

#+begin_src shell
cargo build
#+end_src

Run tests:

#+begin_src shell
cargo test
#+end_src
