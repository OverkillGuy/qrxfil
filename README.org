#+TITLE: qrxfil

Exfiltrate files via QR codes.

Splits files across many QR codes for "sending" across air-gapped
computer systems. Generates numbered PNG files to scan.

The codes contain metadata about chunk number (e.g. "07 of 78") to
enable out-of-order scanning.



* Dependencies

=qrxfil= is built in Rust, relying on:
- [[https://crates.io/crates/base64][base64]], to encode binary in ASCII characters
- [[https://crates.io/crates/qrcode][qrcode]], to generate the codes themselves

This is a toy project meant to learn Rust, for which a Bash proof of
concept was built as reference, see the =scripts/= folder.


* Usage

To generate QR chunks for exfiltration:

#+begin_src shell
cargo run exfil file_to_exfil.txt qr_output_folder/
#+end_src

Once these QR images are scanned (on your own), we can reconstruct the
file from a newline-delimited chunk file:

#+begin_src shell
cargo run restore newline_delimited_chunks.txt restored_file.txt
#+end_src


* Development

Because =rust=, use =cargo= to build the binary

#+begin_src shell
cargo build
#+end_src

Run tests:

#+begin_src shell
cargo test
#+end_src
