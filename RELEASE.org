#+TITLE: Making releases of qrxfil

I am forgetful, and want this project to be perfect. I never remember
the exact details of how to make a release beyond the obvious "bump
versions and tag it".

This page should answer questions like:

- Do I put a "v" prefix in the git tag?
- What annotation do I write?
- Do I need to bump version anywhere but the =Cargo.toml= file?
- What text goes in the Github Release?


* Pre-release checklist: Before you go

- [ ] Check =CHANGELOG.org= for all features since last release
- [ ] Run =make= once more, with feeling
- [ ] Check the CI build of master is green
- [ ] Confirm new version number (major/minor/patch)

All good? Let's release!

* Release checklist

- [ ] Bump version in =CHANGELOG.org=
  - [ ] Update "Unreleased" with =* [x.y.z] - 2020-12-25= (version+timestamp)
  - [ ] Write up a release summary oneliner (<50 chars)
  - [ ] Reintroduce =* [Unreleased]= to top-level
- [ ] Update package version in =Cargo.toml=
- [ ] Run =make= to ensure =Cargo.lock= is updated too
- [ ] Update package version in =README.org= sample =cargo deb= command
- [ ] Commit the bump to master with message =Bump version to vx.y.z=
- [ ] Make a git tag =git tag -am "Release x.y.z" vx.y.z=
- [ ] Git push master
- [ ] Git push the new tag
- [ ] Create new Github Release from tag
  - Use release summary oneliner for "Release title"
  - Use the changelog of the release (minus summary) for "Release Description"
